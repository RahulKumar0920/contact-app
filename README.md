# Contact App

## Features:

• React.js Integration: The project leverages the power of React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. React components are utilized to efficiently update and display contact information.

• Contact Cards: Each contact is represented by a card containing essential information such as name, photo, phone number, and email address. These cards are dynamically generated based on the data retrieved from the local contact.js file.

• Data Fetching: Contact information is fetched from a local contact.js file, which exports an array of contacts as a default module. This allows for easy management and customization of contact data directly within the project.

• Responsive Design: The Contact App is built with a responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes.

• User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, providing users with a seamless experience when managing their contacts.

_Whether you're looking to organize your personal contacts or integrate contact management functionality into your web application, the Contact App project offers a robust solution with its use of React.js and dynamic contact card display._
